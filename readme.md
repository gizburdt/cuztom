## Cuztom Helper

This helper can be used to quickly register Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, Meta Boxes, Menu Pages and Sidebars within your Wordpress projects. Please comment, review, watch, fork and report bugs.

**Version:** 2.9.8  
**Requires:** 3.5 / 3.0+

## Basic usage

Include the main file.
	
	include( 'cuztom/cuztom.php' );
   
### Add Custom Post Types
	
	$book = register_cuztom_post_type( 'Book' );

**Note:** If you're using Custom Post Types, don't forget to *[flush rewrite rules on activation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type#Flushing_Rewrite_on_Activation "Flushing Rewrite Rules on Activation")*.

### Add Custom Taxonomies
	
To add Custom Taxonomies to the newly created Post Type, simply call this method.

	$book->add_taxonomy( 'Author' );
			
You can also call this as a seperate class like this. The second parameter is the Post Type name.

	$taxonomy = register_cuztom_taxonomy( 'Author', 'book' );

### Add Meta Boxes
	
Add Meta Boxes.

	$book->add_meta_box( 
		'meta_box_id',
		'Book Info', 
		array(
			array(
				'name' 			=> 'author',
				'label' 		=> 'Author',
				'description'	=> 'Just a little description',
				'type'			=> 'text'
			)
		)
	);
	
Meta Boxes can be added with their own class too. The second parameter is the Post Type name.

	$box = add_cuztom_meta_box(  
		'meta_box_id',
		'Book Info', 
		'book',
		array(
			'name' 			=> 'author',
			'label' 		=> 'Author',
			'description'	=> 'Just a little description',
			'type'			=> 'text'
		)
	)
	
### Add Sidebars

To register a sidebar, just call this.

	$sidebar = new Cuztom_Sidebar( array(
		'name'				=> 'Sidebar Twee',
		'id'				=> 'sidebar_twee',
		'description'		=> 'Build with an array',
	) );
